# CS673: Algorithms

# Question 1:
```java
    int recursive1(int n) {
        if (n == 0)
            return 0;
        else
            return 1 + recursive1(n - 1);
    }        
```
* The return value is: f(n) = n;

* The time complexity is: O(n)
    T(n): Time complexity of this code when input is n. 
    
    Thought:
    
    ---
    T(1) = i (if) + 1 (return) = c1
    T(n) = 1 (if) + T(n - 1) + 1 (addition) + 1 (return)
    ---
    
    Proof:  

    ---
    T(0) = C1 (Important: Base case)
    T(n) = T(n - 1) + C2 (Recurrence Relation)
    T(n) = T(n - 2) + C2 + C2
    :
    T(n) = T(n - k) + k * C2
    
    when: k = n
    T(n) = T(0) + n * C2 = n * C2 + C1

# Question 2:

```java
    int recursive2(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        return recursive1(n) + recursive2(n - 1);
    }
```
* The time complexity:  

    Proof: 
    T(0) = C1
    T(n) = T(n - 1) + n * C2 + C3 (Recurrence Relation)
    
# Asymptotic: 
    Two curves never cross each other more than once 
    
# Tips:

* Always remenber base cases in Time complexity provement.
* Quadratic function: T(n ^2)

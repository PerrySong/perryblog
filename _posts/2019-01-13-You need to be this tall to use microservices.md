# You need to be this tall to use [micro] services:
* Basic Monitoring, instrumentation, health checks

* Distributed logging, tracing

* Ready to isolate not just code, but whole build+test+package+promote for every service

* Can define upstream/downstream/compile-time/runtime dependencies clearly for each service

* Know how to build, expose and maintain good APIs and contracts

* Ready to honor b/w and f/w compatibility, even if you're the same person consuming this service on the other side

* Good unit testing skills and readiness to do more (as you add more microservices it gets harder to bring everything up, hence more unit/contract/api test driven and lesser e2e driven)

* Aware of [micro] service vs modules vs libraries, distributed monolith, coordinated releases, database-driven integration, etc

* Know infrastructure automation (you'll need more of it)

* Have working CI/CD infrastructure

* Have or ready to invest in development tooling, shared libraries, internal artifact registries, etc

* Have engineering methodologies and process-tools to split down features and develop/track/release them across multiple services (xp, pivotal, scrum, etc)

* A lot more that doesn't come to mind immediately

Thing is - these are all generally good engineering practices.

But with monoliths, you can get away without having to do them. There is the "login to server, clone, run some commands, start a stupid nohup daemon and run ps/top/tail to monitor" way. But with microservices, your average engineering standards have to be really high. Its not enough if you have good developers. You need great engineers.

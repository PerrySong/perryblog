# CS601 Software Development Principle  
    
# Data structure:

* ## List:
    ArrayList add elements to front: O(n)  
    Operations| ArrayList        |LinkedList        
    | ------------- | ------------- |:-------------:| 
    | add | O(1) unless array is filled | O(1) for head and tail|
    | add(pos, element)     |Worst when add to the head|  Worst when add to middle (Java implemented double Linkedlist|
    | remove(index)| need to move every element after that forward| O(n)|
    |clear| O(1) | O(1)|
    |size|O()|O()|

* ## HashMap
    Operations| ArrayList  
    | ----- | -------- |
    | put(key, value) | O(n) |
    | containskey | |
    | get(key) | |
    | keySet | |

    Why we don't use HashMap:
    1. When you want to always loop through the elements.
    2. When you do not have keys.
    3. When you want elements' sequence.

* ## TreeMap
*   Operations| ArrayList  
    | ----- | -------- |
    | put(key, value) | O(lg n) |
    | containskey | |
    | get(key) | |
    | keySet | |

* ## LinkedMap
    Preserve the inerting sequence.  


Tips: 
* KISS: keep it simple
